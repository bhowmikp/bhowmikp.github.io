Objective: Learn importance of terminal and basic commands.

What is the terminal?
- interface where we can type and execute text based commands

Why do we like the terminal?
  - lazy: can do most of the stuff from keyboard without using mouse
  - tighter controls: unix was built terminal up, commands can be piped
  - automation: using scripts


Additional Commands:
  - nano / pico → more text editors
  - rm -rf dir → removes files recursively and forcefully, used to delete directories
  - man command_name → to get more information about a command
