Objective: Learn testing and JUnit.

Types of testing.

There are two types of testing:
  - Black box testing: evaluate functionality of software without looking at
                        internal code structure
  - White box testing: internal structure of the code is looked at to design
                        test cases


How to write good test cases?

- Identify what you're testing, such as what the piece of software does
- Test cases should be brief and short
- One test case should only test one sub-functionality of the software
- Try for 100% coverage testing

- Remember to test for negative scenarios as well
- Remember to test boundary conditions
- Remember to test basic functionality


What is JUnit?

JUnit is a unit testing framework for Java. It just simplies the process for
testing.
