# Synchronization Primitives

- **Process Synchronization** means sharing resources with processes such that chances of inconsistent data is minimized with concurrent access to shared data.
  - **Critical section**: is part of the program that accesses shared resources.
  - **Race condition** is prevented by synchronization. This is when several processes access and manipulate shared data at the same time.
  - **Deadlock**: at least two tasks is holding a lock that the other task holds. If nothing is done they will wait forever
- **Atmoic operation** is when an operation completes in its entirety without interruption.
- **Mutual exclusion** is a mechanism to prevent data inconsistency. One one process is doing something at a certain time
  - Also called mutex
- **POSIX**: standard for maintaining compatibality between operating systems

- **Locks**
  - primitive, minimal semantics
  - provide mutual exclusion
  - operations
    - *acquire*(lock);
    - *release*(lock);
  - downsides: can cause deadlock if not careful
- **Semaphores**
  - easy to understand, hard to code
  - generalizes locks with an integer count variable and a thread queue
  - if integer count is negative then threads wait in queue till signalled
  - operations
    - *wait*: down, decrement, P(proberen)
      - block thread till semaphore is free and decrement variable
    - *signal*: up, increment, V(verhogen)
      - increment variable and unblock waiting thread
- **Condition Variables**
  - allow threads to synchronize based on the value of the data
  - useful for implementing monitors
- **Monitors**
  - high level, ideally language supported
  - abstraction that encapsulates shared data and operations in such a way that only one process can be excuting in the monitor
  - only one process at a time can be active in the monitor. Local data accessed only by monitorâ€™s procedures. Process enters monitor by invoking one of its procedures. Other processes that attempt to enter monitor are blocked.
  - operations
    - *wait*(): suspend the invoking process and release the lock
    - *signal*(): resume exactly one suspended process which was waiting for its condition variable (if any)
    - *broadcast*(): resume all suspended process which was waiting for its condition variable (if any)
  - Types of monitors (who goes first)
    - **Hoare monitor**: waiter first, switches from caller to waiting thread. Easier to reason with, but hard to implement
    - **Mesa monitor**: signaler first, signler continues while waiter placed on ready queue. Easier to implement, and support additional operations like broadcast
- Thread cycle
  - ready <--> running -> blocked -> ready
