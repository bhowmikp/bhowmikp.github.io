This is my personal website. It showcases my portfolio, accomplishments etc. The website is written with Angular. It is a Progressive Web App(PWA), therefore the website can create a mobile and desktop app.

The website also hosts an Accelerated Mobile Page(AMP) version of the [site](https://prantar.me/amp). The AMP site has PWA functionalities and therefore it is loaded faster on mobile devices.

Android app APK was created using [site](https://appmaker.xyz/pwa-to-apk/).
